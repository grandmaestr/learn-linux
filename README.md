# learn-linux
This is a simple bash script that will give a beginner Linux administrators a short description (using "whatis") and dry-run (using "maybe") commands before executing them. I think many self-taught administrators - like myself - have a try-and-see approach to system administration, often copying and pasting commands from a variety of online sources (some trustworthy, and others...not so much). The result is you get (good) practical experience using different commands without necessarily knowing exactly what it is you are doing. While this method of learning is incredibly useful, and perhaps better than a purely theoretical approach, it can also be dangerous and may stunt your growth as a Linux System Administrator. 

To install:
- Download the script (or copy and paste  into a new file)
- Make the file executable with: chmod +x [filename]


/usr/bin/local
