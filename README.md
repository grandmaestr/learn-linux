# top-linux-commands
This is a list of Linux commands from https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/dir_section_1.html. 

The goal is to:
- provide a simple, one-page reference for Linux commands
- act as a starting point for another project I'm ideating. I want to create a simple bash script that will give a beginner Linux administrators short descriptions of each command they run on the CLI before executing it. I think many self-taught administrators - like myself - have a try-and-see approach to system administration, often copying and pasting commands from a variety of online sources (some trustworthy, and others...not so much). The result is you get (good) practical experience using different commands without necessarily knowing exactly what it is you are doing. While this method of learning is incredibly useful, and perhaps better than a purely theoretical approach, it can also be dangerous and may stunt your growth as a Linux System Administrator. I'll add the link to this project here once it's ready. 

Let me know what you think - contributions, comments and suggestions are most welcome!
